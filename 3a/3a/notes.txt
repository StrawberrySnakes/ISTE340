when you use document.images[1].src = "other.jpg"
to change the source of the images

document.forms[0].elements[2]
-- this is grabbing this first form, and the elements are all the form elements 
-- labels are not considered form elements -- textfield, checkboxes ecx. are counted

function funct() {
    //?? how do I know which image was moused over -- use "this"
    // remember the keyword this is on the practical/ I have a reference to the
    thing I clicked on 

    dom.drc = "change"
}
<img src ="one.jpg" onmouseover="funct()"/>
<img src ="2.jpg" onmouseover="funct()"/>
<img src ="3.jpg" onmouseover="funct()"/>
